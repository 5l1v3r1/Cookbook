The cookbook is still in progress.


In the ArangoDB cookbook you will find some recipes for specific problems regarding ArangoDB. 

##How to contribute

Do you have recipes for the ArangoDB Cookbook?  <br>
Write them down and we will add them to the Cookbook.

It's pretty easy. You write a markdown file in the recipes folder. At the end of your recipe you can add your name and some tags so other users can find your recipe faster. The tags should be written in lower case.  

An Example:

**Author**: [yourName](https://github.com/yourName)

**Tags**: #arangodb #cookbook #aql

After that you edit `SUMMARY.md` and simply add a title and the file name to the end of it. 

Now make a pull request and we will add your recipe as soon as possible.
