# Cookbook

This cookbook is filled with recipes to help you understand the [multi-purpose database ArangoDB][1] better
and to help you with specific problems. 

You can participate and [write your own recipes][2]. You only need to write a recipe in markdown and make a [pull request to our repository][2]. 
At the end of the markdown file you should make a list with tags so that people can find specific problems better. Also you should make a link as an author to your own github repository. 

##Recipes

There will be some simple recipes to bring you closer to ArangoDB and show you the amount of possibilities
of our Database. 
There also will be more complex problems to show you solution to specific problems and the depth of ArangoDB.

Every complex recipe is divided into three parts:

1. **Problem**: A description of the problem
2. **Solution**: A detailed solution of the given problem with code if any is needed
3. **Comment**: Explanation of the solution 

The "simple" recipes can also be divided into three parts or just be short without any division.

Every recipe has tags to for a better overview. The tags are:

*#aql*, *#foxx*, *#collection*, *#graph*, *#aql*, *#driver*, *#java*, *#arangosh*, *#documents*, #database
