* Monitoring other relevant metrics of arango

## Problem

[Collectd offers a pleathora of plugins](https://collectd.org/wiki/index.php/Table_of_Plugins); here is a tiny abstract of others that may be interesting to use with ArangoDB


###Ingedients

For this receipie you need to install the following tools:

  * [collectd](https://collectd.org/) The metrics aggregation Daemon
  * we base on [Monitoring with Collecd recipy](MonitoringWithCollectd.html) for understanding the basics about collectd.

###Diskusage
You may want to monitor ArangoDB doesn't run out of disk space. The [df Plugin](https://collectd.org/wiki/index.php/Plugin:DF) can aggregate these values for you.

First we need to find out which disks are used by your arango. By default you need to find **/var/lib/arango** in the mountpoints; Since nowadays many virtual filesystems are also mounted on a typical *nix system we want to sort the output of mount:

    mount | sort
    /dev/sda3 on /local/home type ext4 (rw,relatime,data=ordered)
    /dev/sda4 on / type ext4 (rw,relatime,data=ordered)
    /dev/sdb1 on /mnt type vfat (rw,relatime,fmask=0022,dmask=0022,codepage=437,iocharset=utf8,shortname=mixed,errors=remount-ro)
    binfmt_misc on /proc/sys/fs/binfmt_misc type binfmt_misc (rw,relatime)
    cgroup on /sys/fs/cgroup/blkio type cgroup (rw,nosuid,nodev,noexec,relatime,blkio)
    ....
    udev on /dev type devtmpfs (rw,relatime,size=10240k,nr_inodes=1022123,mode=755)

So here we can see the mountpoints are **/**, **/local/home**, **/mnt/** so **/var/lib/** can befound on the root partition (**/**) **/dev/sda3** here. A production setup may be different so the OS doesn't interfere with the services.

The collectd configuration /etc/collectd/collectd.conf.d/diskusage.conf looks like this:

    LoadPlugin df
    <Plugin df>
      Device "/dev/sda3"
      #  Device "192.168.0.2:/mnt/nfs"
      #  MountPoint "/home"
      #  FSType "ext4"
      #  ignore rootfs; else, the root file-system would appear twice, causing
      #  one of the updates to fail and spam the log
      FSType rootfs
      # ignore the usual virtual / temporary file-systems
      FSType sysfs
      FSType proc
      FSType devtmpfs
      FSType devpts
      FSType tmpfs
      FSType fusectl
      FSType cgroup
      IgnoreSelected true
      #  ReportByDevice false
      #  ReportReserved false
      #  ReportInodes false
      #  ValuesAbsolute true
      #  ValuesPercentage false
    </Plugin>

###Disk I/O Usage
Another interesting metric is the amount of data read/written to disk - its an estimate how busy your ArangoDB or the whole system currently is.
The [Disk plugin](https://collectd.org/wiki/index.php/Plugin:Disk) aggregates these values.

According to the mountpoints above our configuration /etc/collectd/collectd.conf.d/disk_io.conf looks like this:

    LoadPlugin disk
    <Plugin disk>
    	Disk "hda"
    	Disk "/sda[23]/"
    	IgnoreSelected false
    </Plugin>


###CPU Usage
While the arangodb self monitoring already offers some overview of the running threads etc. you can get a deeper view using the [Process Plugin](https://collectd.org/wiki/index.php/Plugin:Processes).

If you're running a single arango instance, a simple match by process name is sufficient, /etc/collectd/collectd.conf.d/arango_process.conf looks like this:

    LoadPlugin processes
    <Plugin processes>
      Process "arangod"
    </Plugin>

If you're running a cluster, you can match the specific instances by commandline parameters, /etc/collectd/collectd.conf.d/arango_cluster.conf looks like this:

    LoadPlugin processes
    <Plugin processes>
      ProcessMatch "Claus" "/usr/bin/arangod .*--cluster.my-id Claus.*"
      ProcessMatch "Pavel" "/usr/bin/arangod .*--cluster.my-id Pavel.*"
      ProcessMatch "Perry" "/usr/bin/arangod .*--cluster.my-id Perry.*"
      Process "etcd-arango"
    </Plugin>

### More Plugins
As mentioned above, the list of available plugins is huge; Here are some more one could be interested in:
* Use the [CPU Plugin](https://collectd.org/wiki/index.php/CPU) to monitor the overal cpu utilisation
* Use the [Memory Plugin](https://collectd.org/wiki/index.php/Plugin:Memory) to monitor main memory availability
* use the [Swap Plugin](https://collectd.org/documentation/manpages/collectd.conf.5.shtml#plugin_swap) to see whether excess RAM usage forces the system to page and thus slow down
* [Ethernet Statistics](https://collectd.org/wiki/index.php/Plugin:Ethstat) with whats going on at your Network cards to get a more broad overview of network traffic
* you may [Tail logfiles](https://collectd.org/wiki/index.php/Plugin:Tail) like an apache requset log and pick specific requests by regular expressions
* [Parse tabular files](https://collectd.org/wiki/index.php/Plugin:Table) in the /proc filesystem
* you can use [filters](https://collectd.org/documentation/manpages/collectd.conf.5.shtml#filter_configuration) to reduce the amount of data created by plugins (i.e. if you have many CPU cores, you may want the combined result); It can also decide where to route data to which writer plugin.
* While you may have seen that metrics are stored at a fixed rate or frequency, your metrics (i.e. the durations of webrequests) may come in a random & higher frequency. Thus you want to burn them down to a fixed frequency, and know Min/Max/Average/Median. So you want to  [Aggregate values using the statsd pattern](https://collectd.org/wiki/index.php/Plugin:StatsD).
* You may start rolling your own in [Python](https://collectd.org/wiki/index.php/Plugin:Python), [java](https://collectd.org/wiki/index.php/Plugin:Java), [Perl](https://collectd.org/wiki/index.php/Plugin:Perl) or for shure in [C](https://collectd.org/wiki/index.php/Plugin_architecture), the Language collectd is implemented in.

Finaly while kcollectd is nice to get a quick success at inspecting your collected metrics during working your way into collectd, its not as sufficient for operating a production site. Since collectds default storage RRD is already widespread in system monitoring, there are [many webfrontents](https://collectd.org/wiki/index.php/List_of_front-ends) to choose for the visualisation. Some of them replace the RRD storage by simply adding a writer plugin, most prominent the [Graphite graphing framework](http://graphite.wikidot.com/screen-shots) with the [Graphite writer](https://collectd.org/wiki/index.php/Plugin:Write_Graphite) which allows you to combine random metrics in single graphs - to find coincidences in your data [you never dreamed of](http://metrics20.org/media/). 

If you already run [Nagios](http://www.nagios.org) you can use the [Nagios tool](https://collectd.org/documentation/manpages/collectd-nagios.1.shtml) to submit values.

We hope you now have a good overview of whats possible, but as usual its a good idea to browse the [Fine Manual](https://collectd.org/documentation.shtml).
