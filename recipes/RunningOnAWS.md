ArangoDB is available as AMI on the [AWS Marketplace][1]. 

(If you've already a running ArangoDB image on AWS and need an update, please have a look at [Updating ArangoDB on AWS](UpdateArangoDBOnAWS.md)).

Now log in with your AWS Account or create a new one.

After that you should select the **1-Click Launch** tab and select the size of the instance (**EC2 Instance Type**) you wish to use.

Now you can continue with a click on **Accept Terms & Launch with 1-Click**.

**Note**: If you do not have a key pair a warning will appear after clicking and you will be asked to generate a key pair.
